# Nadia

I built Nadia as my final project or portfolio project for ALX - Holberton School of Software Engineering training as Full Stack Software Engineer. It was a unique opportunity to put everything I learned especially Python and it's Flask framework to test. 

nadia is a platform to find and book Physiotherapists either for homeservice or in-clinic sessions. It is also a platform to find clinics with Physiotherapy units or Resident Physiotherapists. Searches are performed by City names. You enter city name and therapists in the city pops up. Simple.

## The Story 
According to Guardian ratio of Physiotherapist to population or distribution of Physiotherapists in Nigeria is 1 Therapist to 170, 000 people. For context global ratio is 1 therapist to 4000 people. 
With this poor figure in Nigeria and neighboring western African countries, there is need seamlessly link up the Therapists to Patients in near real time.


### The name - nadia

I came up with the name when searching for a name, specifically a female name that resonates with what Physiotherapy is all about. Nadia have to possible origins: Russian and Arabic
In it's Russian roots Nadia stands for HOPE
In it's Arabic roots Nadia stands for "delicate and fragile"

I believe those three words captures the entirety of Physiotherapy hence I chose to name the project Nadia.
