# Nadia
<img src="/AssetUpload/hero.jpg">

I built Nadia as my final project or portfolio project for ALX - Holberton School of Software Engineering training as Full Stack Software Engineer. It was a unique opportunity to put everything I learned especially Python and it's Flask framework to test. 

nadia is a platform to find and book Physiotherapists either for homeservice or in-clinic sessions. It is also a platform to find clinics with Physiotherapy units or Resident Physiotherapists. Searches are performed by City names. You enter city name and therapists in the city pops up. Simple.

## The Story 
According to Guardian ratio of Physiotherapist to population or distribution of Physiotherapists in Nigeria is 1 Therapist to 170, 000 people. For context global ratio is 1 therapist to 4000 people. 
With this poor figure in Nigeria and neighboring western African countries, there is need seamlessly link up the Therapists to Patients in near real time.


### The name - nadia

I came up with the name when searching for a name, specifically a female name that resonates with what Physiotherapy is all about. Nadia have to possible origins: Russian and Arabic
In it's Russian roots Nadia stands for HOPE
In it's Arabic roots Nadia stands for "delicate and fragile"

I believe those three words captures the entirety of Physiotherapy hence I chose to name the project Nadia.



## Features 


## Technology Stack 
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) - General purpose programming language with wide application in backend web development

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) - Python based lightweight webframework

[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - Frontend scripting language

[Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)) - Free Open source CSS framework.


## Future
The future of this application starts immediately after my graduation from Holberton ALX Software Engineering training. I will focus on cleaning up existing features of the application while adding more features some of which will include: 
* API endpoints for mobile app
* Developing the mobile app
* Improving existing admin dashboard
* Integrating content management system like wordpress
* Therapists can create plans/packages
* AI powered patient recovery assistant
* Integration with Vivianehealth suit of medical softwares.
* Incorporation and growing a team

Next would be marketing efforts and exploring equity based investments. Bootstrapping however is the first choice.

When or if **nadia** finally becomes profitable, larger percentage of the profit will go to charity courses in areas of:
* **Spine Health related cases and research**
* **Regerative Medicine**
* **And scholarships in the above named fields**
